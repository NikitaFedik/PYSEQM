# PYSEQM: Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics with PYtorch

PYSEQM is a module for  Born Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD) and Extended Lagrangian  BOMD based on Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics. It has efficient molecular dynamic engines with GPU supported and it is implemented in Python 3 with machine learning framework [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). Several geometric optimization and thermostat algoritms are included for facilitating simulations.
